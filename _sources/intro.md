# Introduction

This site contains supporting information for a paper in progress on predicting f-divergence measures from catchment attributes.  Catchment attributes are widely used in hydrological modelling and other environmental applications because of their associations with the hydrological response of catchments.  The f-divergence measures are a family of statistical measures that quantify the difference between two probability distributions.  

Hydrological signatures are minimal representations of process information contained in streamflow observations {cite}`gupta2008reconciling`. There is a large body of literature defining and describing the use of hydrological signatures in various fields of hydrology, see "*A review of hydrological signatures and their applications*" {cite}`mcmillan2021review`. To our knowledge, f-divergence measures have not been used as hydrological signatures.  The aim of this work is to view various f-divergence measures through the lens of hydrological signatures and investigate their predictability from catchment attributes.
