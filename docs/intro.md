# Introduction

This site contains supporting information for a paper in progress on predicting f-divergence measures from catchment attributes.  Catchment attributes are widely used in hydrological modelling and other environmental applications because of their associations with hydrological behaviour.  There is a large body of literature defining and describing the use of hydrological signatures in various fields of hydrology, see "*A review of hydrological signatures and their applications*" {cite}`mcmillan2021review`. 

The f-divergence measures are a family of statistical measures that quantify the difference between two probability distributions.  The aim of this work is to investigate the predictability of f-divergence measures from catchment attributes.  The work is motivated by the potential for f-divergence measures to provide a novel approach to monitoring network design.
